In computational coordinates, two physical solutions and meshes which look similar (in physical coordinate land) can be just differant enough to have large norms of their differences.\n","\n","- Also, we could have the same solution (ish) with slightly different meshes but the mesh norm will cause this squarted norm to be large.\n","\n","- We think, instead, we want some version of the following for the norm:\n","\n","        uz_norm = assemble( uz * uz * xz.dx(0) * dx )\n","        uw_norm = assemble( uw * uw * xw.dx(0) * dx )\n","        u_norm_diff = (uz_norm - uw_norm)**2\n","where we only monitor the differences in the physical solutions and we do so in their respective physical coordinates (jacobian transformations in these integrals bring us from computational to physical coordinate land)\n","\n","- We started working on this updated norm but we didnt get it done\n","\n","- Another thing to experiment with is a larger power parameter in the Deflation operator.
